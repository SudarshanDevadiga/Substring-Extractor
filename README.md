# Substring Extractor

This is a simple C++ program that extracts a substring from a given string.

## How it works

1. The program initializes a string `s1` with the value "Iomhar".
2. The program extracts a substring from `s1` starting at index 3 with a length of 2 characters.
3. The program prints the extracted substring.
